## Context

I spent some much needed time at home in India. It was wonderful. I got to skip the cold, dark Canadian winter which is worse when you consider the isolation of lockdown and I got to spend time surrounded by family and friends. Over the last month that I've come back, I've noticed the days were getting longer and warmer. I was looking forward to a normal summer without masks.

Then Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th 2022. Just when I thought the two year long dumpster fire that was the covid-19 pandemic was backing off. Just when we were looking forward to some semblance of "normalcy". It can feel unsettling under such circumstances to fankly just live. I realize the privileged position I'm in, I've had better circumstances than millions of people. Yet this upsets me in ways I cannot describe or I don't feel I deserve to justify. With some help I've come to see that being upset, angry, sad is okay it's a part of the human experience package. Whether you're in a position like me or not, if this upsets you too, then I want you to know that it is okay to be upset. To not see any point. To feel uneasy when you have to work or study. I've been struggling with this since the start of 2021. In 2020 the pandemic in the summer months seemed temporary, but as winter hit and it seemed like there was no end in sight. But I'm starting to see a glimmer of light up ahead.

I turned to a couple of things to keep me afloat, food, music and books served as my coping mechanism. I joined <a href="https://www.stoa.com">Stoa</a>. At one point I got into this bad habit of opening and saving link to articles almost compulsively. When I <a href="https://twitter.com/rheardgs/status/1511461847995600896?s=20&t=kyqXwQuUbM7SN-yuCloY3Q">tweeted</a> about this complusive behaviour it seemed to resonate with a few thousands of people. I decided to put an end to my bad habit by actually going through these bookmarks, making a note of it, and feeling the peace and satisfaction of closing that mental and physical open tab. Here is a list of the most of them.

## Pieces from all the open tabs I didn't close

1. [Your Cup Runneth Over](https://storythings.com/work/your-cup-runneth-over/) is a short piece by Lavanya Lakshminarayan. It is a surreal Banglore based sci-fi that unfolds a decade later. In it she examines a potential impending reality that seems within reach and it is a reality I believe we should be questioning. What strikes me most and what I hope will not dominate ten years from today is the ad-based business models that incentivize companies and exploit users today. I learned about this piece from [this episode](https://www.ft.com/content/33c87210-fd1f-4130-8dfe-7263612e490a) of the [FT Weekend podcast](https://www.ft.com/ftweekendpodcast)- which I throughly enjoy and look forward to every single weekend. 

2. [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) says <i><b>never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity</b></i>. Or that some bad things happen not because of people having bad intentions, but because they did not think it through. I don't remember how I stumbled across this, but it has been useful to explain some situations I have found myself in.

3. Marina Keegan's essay in the Yale's college newspaper, [The Opposite of Loneliness](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/) was open on a browser tab on my phone for a very long time. I finally read it today, it's moving and a piece that lets readers know we're not alone. Losing Marina was tragic to say the least and it's a quite reminder of the fragility of the privilege to experience at all. Marina's humanity shines through this piece and I'm looking forward to reading [her compilation of essays](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143905-the-opposite-of-loneliness).

4. This next one is a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/bEg5ySTUGxE) by Pablo Stanley that has been open for ages in a browser tab oddly enough, versus the Watch Later playlist I'm continually managing. His presentation is genius, hilarious yet critical about the design industry, and throughly entertaining! Designers watching will certainly relate and as someone who isn't a designer this connects me with the designers I know. Pablo Stanley exectues this talk with an exceptional sense of humour. I did a little digging (because I'm a pyscho who likes increasing the unending collection of internet content she consumes) and found [his collection of comics](https://thedesignteam.io).

5. [The Open Christmas Letter](https://www.futilitycloset.com/2021/11/28/the-open-christmas-letter/) is an exchange of letters at Christmas time during the World War I by women on opposing fronts coming togther in solidarity. It's brief, so read it sometime and it will allow you to appreciate the relative peace we've been enjoying in the last couple of decades (I'm writing this as we Russia continues to invade Ukraine for the fourth week). It also made me realize the necessity of women in offices of power.

6. [The Productivity apps I use in 2022](https://dev.to/cassidoo/the-productivity-apps-i-use-in-2022-ea6) by Cassidy Williams is about her productivity tools stack. She mentions [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which I want to explore someday. She says that you have to commit to the productivity tools you use or they'll just become more overhead and add to the overwhelm.

7. [Career advice for the young and confused](https://thecmojournal.substack.com/p/career-advice-for-the-young-and-confused?s=r) by Sairam Krishnan. It's a reassuring reminder of advice that is easy to forget in this overly stimulated world. He makes three points, do your time at the start of your career, learn to write simply, pick a niche and let it compound for 5-6 years.

8. [Statistics Done Wrong](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/) seems like a treasure trove of knowledge that I will someday learn of. I am a just a lowly computer scientist with a fascination for a this subject, because hypotheses, p-values, and significances mystify me. Moreover, I find it hard to swallow the idea that a value a little bit higher or lower than 0.05 can determine the results of an experiment. I want to read and learn about this subject so I can figure out this mystery. 
I don't recall how I stumbled onto it, but the specific tab I had open was [this one](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/significant-differences.html). And the page I want to read next is on [p-values](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/data-analysis.html#p-values).

9. This tab has been open on my phone browser for over a year! It's about [investing in ETFs](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2020/01/28/how-to-set-up-a-hands-off-etf-portfolio/). So no I haven't read it yet, because <i><b>I've been waiting for the right time</b></i>. I've been told from a trustworthy source that [Dan Bortolotti's Blog](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/) is a stellar resource to learn about investing in specifically in Canada. I'm also looking forward to someday reading his book- fingers crossed- maybe <b><i>then</i></b> I'll feel ready. Alright, as I typed that I realized I will never be ready. I just got to start. Just start!

10. 2021 was a year I over-dosed on inspirational, self-help, how-to-live, etc content on the internet. And consuming that content was a bad idea in retrospect because it reinforced the notion of what I was lacking. However, [HBR](https://hbr.org/) had some pieces that made sense and didn't leave me feeling despair. There's the [essay by Christensen](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life) that I have gone back to on occasion. This essay on [Managing Your Energy](https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time) has become almost mainstream and for good reason. Anyway, the specific tab I had open on my phone was [a piece on Purpose](https://hbr.org/2017/10/you-dont-find-your-purpose-you-build-it)- something I questioned especially excessively last year in 2021. And like [Christensen's essay](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life) this one is a reassuring reminder that we must create meaning and purpose deliberately, as opposed to the discouraging and frankly toxic pop culture notion that these are senses we must <i>stumble upon by chance<i> or <i>constantly be seeking</i>. Here is another article on [Meaning In Work by Coleman](https://hbr.org/2017/12/to-find-meaning-in-your-work-change-how-you-think-about-it?ab=at_art_art_1x1) that I found helpful, because I've struggled to see the value in my work in the past. Coleman says, <i><b>"remember that your work is an act of service for those you care about in your personal life. Keeping this front of mind will help you tie more purpose into your work, even when accomplishing the most tedious of tasks"</b></i>.

11. I'm a huge fan of [Tim Harford's work in general](https://timharford.com/). I might not find every book appealing and it could take a lifetime to get through [some of the books Harford read in a single year](https://timharford.com/2021/11/my-books-of-the-year-2021/), but I think this is list of recommendations as good as any.

12. [Cassidy Williams'](https://github.com/readme/stories/cassidy-williams)

13. [The Algebra of Wealth by Scott Galloway](https://www.profgalloway.com/the-algebra-of-wealth/) is Galloway's suggestions for leading a kind of life that is becoming harder to lead. I think this excerpt sums it up and, I like this excerpt a lot, "What can you do in the face of a system that profits off you becoming overweight, indebted, divided, and addicted? Answer: Rebel. Focus on what matters. Be a Stoic in the face of temptation. Use Time to your advantage. Diversify your investments". He has a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42872963-the-algebra-of-happiness), that I'm not going to read (anytime soon at least), because I think I get the gist from this essay. And like he says, he knew the right things to do for decades but the discipline to practice that was what made all the difference.

14. [npr](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/07/655345630/how-fruit-became-so-sugary)

15. [How to waste your career, one comfortable year at a time](https://apoorvagovind.substack.com/p/how-to-waste-your-career-one-comfortable?s=r) is a substack piece. It's okay. Good old pop-culture restated wisdom with a catchy title that is easy to read but difficult to implement. The part of this piece that I like is a subtitled "Complacency is cancer". Here is the excerpt.
~~~
One common trait I've observed in all great engineers is their sense of adventure. People who pigeonhole themselves into a specialty and do the exact same job for years tend to grow complacent. The problem is that stability is an innate human instinct. So you need to deliberately counterbalance this tendency. Taking risks and being uncomfortable is a muscle you have to train.

A friend of mine told me this story about wild ducks — Wild ducks migrate in the winter not because of the cold but because of the food. If you feed them, they won't migrate. Keep feeding them for a few years in a row, still won't migrate. Then stop all of a sudden, they won't migrate, and they'll die. The moral is that you can tame wild ducks, but you can't wildify tamed ducks (that's why there isn't even such a word as wildify). So you have to be careful not to lose that hustle. 

It's especially hard not to grow complacent when your job presents the same challenges repeatedly but beware of reputation damage. Don't think that people won't notice your lack of initiative. It shows on your resume in the form of years in the same position without a promotion or significant achievement to speak of. People know. Many top founders and companies in the valley treat such engineers as walking red flags. Your choice becomes limited to employers who want a cog in the big machine while your career will fade into a 9-5 job. If you are ambitious and want to build a good reputation for yourself in the valley, if you don't want your talent to go to waste - treat complacency like cancer. 
~~~
That last sentence is key, "If you are ambitious...". I am fairly certain a lot of people don't want to say it but I'm going to. Being ambitious (or not) is a conscious choice you make. I think it is absolutely one hundered percent perfect to be "unambitious", just as perfect it is to be "ambitious". To not have the desire to win an award or a gold medal. To do something for the fun of it, for the sake of it, that should not be given a bad rep. To feel less than because you don't <i>want</i> something is comical. This is <i>your life</i>, it matters what <i>you</i> want or do not want. So don't feel bad for not being ambitious, for not wanting to be 'first in your class', or not wanting to 'have an impact on the world' or 'change the world' or 'make this world a better place'. While those aspirations are wonderful, there are other possible equally wonderful aspirations like wanting to 'be fit and eat healthy', or wanting to 'spend time with your family', or wanting to 'be a good person to your friends and neighbours and colleagues'. It <i>can</i> be this simple.


16. [How Much Amazing Can You Handle?](https://medium.com/reboot-leadership-resiliency/how-much-amazing-can-you-handle-2cf32a33d8eb) is a Medium.com essay for which I don't recall the reason for opening it on my browser. It explains the science behind wanting to remain in the comfort zone and it explains the self-sabotaging thoughts when things are actually finally going great. To quote, <i><b>"The things we have survived become the things upon which our survival depends. To break that down even more: if we survived a household of chaos and mayhem, then chaos and mayhem feel ok to our nervous systems, regardless of how awful that may have felt way back then." And, "The conditions we have survived become the conditions upon which our survival depends. Our brain functions with this evolutionary programming. Like a buggy system, it gets in the way of us making lasting change towards what we say we want and what happens when what we say we want (love, success, other good fulfilling things) shows up in our lives".</i></b> The author suggests breathing when we're venturing to do something outside our comfort zone. She says, <i><b>"When you’re at your edge and about to shut down the expansion efforts and return to the status quo, there are tools to try. Breathing is a good exercise to keep handy at the points when your expansion starts to contract. (Yes, Breathing. it can be that simple. And, it tells your brain that you’re alive — surviving! — while stepping out into new territory.). While the amygdala bug is tricky, the good news is that it is workable to an extent due to another amazing feature of the brain: the power of your creative imagination. When used for good (not for catastrophizing and worrying) the imagination can provide a ladder of escape from places that hold you stuck. With the right guide and willingness, a clear path to what we desire can be filled with more ease (as opposed to more stuckage, stress, paralysis, etc.). An interesting question to be in monologue with yourself (and all of the parts of yourself) about is: “how much amazing can I handle?” It’s a good question to play with using your positive imagination. Daydream up the visions of what you’d like, feel yourself in those situations and future moments, and breathe. Often as humans, we deny ourselves the very fantasticness we long for in this life. It takes conscious work to find more choice points along the way to help our scared and skeptical parts trust that all that goodness is can be enjoyed safely."</b></i>

17. [The transformative power of games](https://www.ft.com/content/c2f8b5b6-1f30-48cc-a098-71484ded9a00) is a reflection on boardgames we play in the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/). It elicits nostalgia and the desire to pull out a dusty board game box in the evening. Growing up my family had a huge carrom board so every year when the monsoon came and we couldn't play outdoors my friends came home too. We'd pull out this massive board, play till our knuckles were sore. And I remember the first night at a hill station in winter, my parents taught me- and not my brother- how to play rummy. That shifted the power dynamic between me and my parents, I had a sense of empowerment in those moments. And I was an introvert growing up, spending more time indoors than the other kids. We had a help called Sushila who cleaned, cooked, slept, and ate food with us. My brother was 6 and I 8, parents worked full-time, so Sushila was an important person in my life. And she accepted me completely. I remember vivdly and fondly, a game she taught me with halves of tamrind seeds we'd move about on a hand drawn grid on paper. I remember it being summer vacation in the afternoon when the doors were closed by the sunlight was the deepest and warmest golden. I don't remember the rules, but I remember feeling seen, and heard, and happy. We played this silly game with my brother where you throw these fine sticks with colors labelled and try to lift them without touching the other colors. I miss that so much. I hope Sushila is well. I wish I could tell her I'm well. It's been a while so I'm going to spend Friday night this week over a piece of cardboard with friends.

18. [The Staggering Ecological Impacts of Computation and the Cloud](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-staggering-ecological-impacts-of-computation-and-the-cloud/
) is eplores the cultural significance of the cloud and its environmental impact. Anthropologist Steven Gonzalez Monserrate draws on five years of research and fieldwork in server farms to illustrate some of the diverse environmental impacts of data storage. Monserrate shares findings from visits to server "farms", how fragile this electronic equipment is, the expensive temperature controlled cooling chambers these library of servers must exist in. The local people complain of a incessant droning noise in their background. The question of, how do we manage the electronic waste from the myriad devices that were designed to not last? Monserrate shines a light on concerns I've held for a long time. Particularly, the carbon emmisions from our collective use electronic devices. 


19. In [Why economists hate gifts](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/16/1064865987/why-economists-hate-gifts-encore) Tim Harford talks about the inefficiency of exchanging gifts especially on the holidays. He says a gifting items from a registry with perhaps a personal letter is proven to make the receiver happy and it is efficient for the economy. I agree with Harford, I would love receiving exactly what I want and I love it when someebody takes the time to write down some nice thoughts for me. That is so special. And I love writing letters for my close friends on special occasions. 

20. [Why Simple Is Smart](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/writing-tips-for-journalists-jargon-simplicity/621411/) is a short article on writing advice. The first three pointers were useful. First, 'Simple is smart', and to quote, "Smart people respect simple language not because simple words are easy, but because expressing interesting ideas in small words takes a lot of work". On simialar lines, I was listenenting to a podcast recently (ezra's nyt crypto discussion) and one line stuck with me: "complicated is dangerous" and I heard a similar line in another podcast "how to identify what you enjoy by how to build a happy life". Coming back, the other two pointer on writing were 'Be interesting' where "interestingness = novelty + importance". And finally, the third pointer is 'Write music', and to quote, "Music is a delivery system for memory. So, don’t be afraid to write musically. Or, to rephrase that sentiment with a dash of antimetabole: If you want people to remember your writing, write to be remembered". The fourth and final pointer is 'Find the right skin thickness', which is similar to a line Taylor Swift mentioned in the Miss Americana documentary, "... with a sharp pen, thin skin and open heart".  Lots of good generic advice that is applicable to writing well.


21. [Treat your to-read pile like a river, not a bucket](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/river), talks about "To return to information overload: this means treating your "to read" pile like a river (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it). " and "Coming at life this way definitely entails tough choices. But it's liberating, too, as you slowly begin to grasp that you never had any other option. There's no point beating yourself up for failing to clear a backlog (of unread books, undone tasks, unrealized dreams) that it was always inherently unfeasible to clear in the first place. I like to think of it as the productivity technique to beat all productivity techniques: finally internalizing the implications of the fact that what's genuinely impossible – the clue is in the name! – cannot actually be done."

22. [Never](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/never). The last two paragraphs were lovely and nicely written, "Meditation provides a useful model here, because most meditation teachers acknowledge explicitly that "stopping thinking" isn't really the goal; instead, falling off the wagon (by getting distracted) then getting back on (by returning to your breath) is the whole game. One might reframe other things this way, too. Your goal as a runner needn't be to get to a place where it's effortless to set off at 630am, day after day. It could just be to get better and better, every time you skip a morning and stay in bed, at starting again the next day.

29. This dialouge from some place I cannot remember.

When I let myself be permeated by this thought – that I might be stuck with certain inner disturbances forever – I definitely feel a bit of peevishness in response: "Wait, I'm never going to get to the problem-free phase? That's not what I signed up for!" But then comes the sense of a heavy burden having been lifted. The pressure's off. I get to unclench, relax, and fall back into the life I'm living. Far from this being dispiriting, I find myself much more motivated to get stuck in. It turns out my really big problem was thinking I might one day get rid of all my problems, when the truth is that there's no escaping the mucky, malodorous compost-heap of this reality. Which is OK, actually. Compost is the stuff that helps things grow. "

<hr>

I've become charmed by people on the internet I haven't met. And my enchantment with them has very little to no solid basis. I want to stop opening tabs from a tweet I saw that might 'make me smarter'. I want to consume the little meaningful stuff specific to my career and life goals for a while. None of this fomo energy is coming along into the rest of 2022. Good riddance.
