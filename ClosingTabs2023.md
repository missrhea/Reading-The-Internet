Last year, I created a list of articles that I had put very little thought into bookmarking until the bookmarks became overwhelming. I took on the (difficult) project of reading through those articles as an exercise to teach myself not to mindlessly bookmark (click-baity) content. And I can report that it worked, I noticed that my tendency to bookmark content (that I would likely never revisit again) reduced, even though it didn't end.

So, surprise surprise it is the middle of 2023 now and I have a bunch of bookmarks piled up. This is going to be a running list of articles and pieces from around the internet that I bookmarked. Depending on how interested I was when I revisited the bookmarks I simply unsaved it or ended up reading it. And these are the pieces I ended up reading and found interesting.
